Aim:To identify the actors, list the use cases, and create a structured use case model for the project Campus Map with Interactive Navigation.

Objective:
Identify all the external and internal actors.
Define the system's functionalities (use cases).
Present a text-based representation of a UML Use Case Diagram.
Describe key use case scenarios.


Project Title:
Campus Map with Interactive Navigation

1. Identifying Actors


Actor	Description
Visitor	A user who can search for locations and navigate without logging in.
Student	A registered user who can log in and access personalized features.
Admin	Responsible for managing campus data and map updates.
GPS/Wi-Fi System	External service that provides real-time location data.

2. Identifying Use Cases


Use Case ID	Use Case Name	Description
UC1	View Campus Map	Allows the user to access the campus map interface.
UC2	Search Building/Location	User can search for any building or area on campus.
UC3	Get Navigation Route	System provides route from user location to selected destination.
UC4	Filter by Facility Type	Filter map items (labs, hostels, cafeterias, etc.)
UC5	View Accessibility Options	View info on wheelchair access, ramps, elevators, etc.
UC6	Admin Login	Allows admin to securely log in.
UC7	Update Map Data	Admin can add/edit buildings or map routes.
UC8	Sync with GPS/Wi-Fi	System syncs with GPS/Wi-Fi to track current position.
UC9	User Login/Register	Login or register for enhanced features (students only).


3. Textual Use Case Diagram (Description)

Here’s how the actors interact with the use cases:

Visitor:
→ View Campus Map
→ Search Building/Location
→ Get Navigation Route
→ Filter by Facility Type
→ View Accessibility Options
Student (inherits from Visitor):
→ User Login/Register
→ Same features as Visitor
Admin:
→ Admin Login
→ Update Map Data
GPS/Wi-Fi System:
→ Sync with GPS/Wi-Fi


4. Use Case Scenarios

UC2 – Search Building/Location
Primary Actor: Visitor / Student
Precondition: Map is loaded.
Main Flow:

User clicks on search bar.
Types the name of the location (e.g., “Library”).
System shows suggestions and highlights the building on the map.
User selects a result.
UC3 – Get Navigation Route
Primary Actor: Visitor / Student
Precondition: User has selected a destination.
Main Flow:

System gets current location via GPS/Wi-Fi.
Calculates shortest route to selected location.
Draws the path on the map.
Optionally provides voice or step-by-step guidance.
UC7 – Update Map Data
Primary Actor: Admin
Precondition: Admin is logged in.
Main Flow:

Admin selects “Update Map” option.
Enters/edit new building info or path.
System validates input.
Map is updated after confirmation.

Result:

Successfully identified actors, use cases, and written detailed scenarios for the Campus Map with Interactive Navigation project.

Conclusion:

Modeling use case diagrams helps in understanding user-system interaction and defining functional boundaries. It also serves as a foundation for further design activities like sequence diagrams and class diagrams.
