Aim:
To create a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) and Control Flow Diagram (CFD) for the project Campus Map with Interactive Navigation to visualize system processes and control logic.

ðŸ§ª Objective:
To model the flow of data between system processes and external entities using DFD.
To represent the logical flow of control among different operations using CFD.
ðŸ§­ Project Title:

Campus Map with Interactive Navigation

ðŸ“„ 1. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

âž¤ Level 0 (Context Level DFD):
External Entities:

User (Visitor or Student)
Admin
GPS/Wi-Fi System
Process:

Campus Navigation System
Data Stores:

Map Database
User Credentials
Location Logs
Data Flow:

User â†’ Request Map â†’ Campus Navigation System
Admin â†’ Update Map Data â†’ Campus Navigation System
GPS â†’ Provide Current Location â†’ Campus Navigation System
Campus Navigation System â†” Map Database (retrieve/store data)
Campus Navigation System â†” User Credentials (for login/registration)
Campus Navigation System â†’ Route Instructions â†’ User
âž¤ Level 1 DFD (Breakdown of Campus Navigation System):

Process ID	Process Name	Input	Output
1.0	User Login & Registration	Login/Register Request	Success/Error Message
2.0	Search Location	Location Name	Location Info
3.0	Route Calculation	Current Location, Destination	Navigation Path
4.0	Admin Map Management	Updated Map Info	Updated Map Data
5.0	Sync with GPS/Wi-Fi	Trigger Signal	Current Location Data
ðŸ§  2. Control Flow Diagram (CFD)

âž¤ Control Flow Description (Textual Format)
ðŸ§© Main Control Logic:

START
User launches application.
If (user = student) â†’ login/register â†’ validate via credentials DB.
Show interactive map.
User selects feature:
If (Search location) â†’ capture input â†’ highlight result.
If (Get directions) â†’ retrieve current location â†’ calculate path â†’ display route.
If (Filter facilities) â†’ apply category filter â†’ update map view.
If (Admin access) â†’ verify admin â†’ access update panel â†’ save new map data.
END
âž¤ Control Decisions (Key Points):
Login success/failure â†’ determines access to features.
Location found/not found â†’ alternative suggestions.
GPS available/unavailable â†’ fall back to manual input.
Admin validated/not validated â†’ allow or restrict admin features.
âœ… Result:

The Data Flow Diagram and Control Flow Diagram were successfully modeled for the Campus Map with Interactive Navigation system, showing a clear structure of data movement and control flow decisions.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion:

DFDs help in analyzing system processes and how data moves between them.
CFDs are crucial in understanding logic and control transitions within the application.
Both diagrams provide a solid foundation for software design and testing.
