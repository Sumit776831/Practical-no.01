 Aim:
To model the UML Class Diagram of the Campus Map with Interactive Navigation project by identifying key classes, their attributes and methods, and the relationships among them.

🧪 Objective:
Understand the structure and behavior of the system using UML class diagrams.
Identify classes, attributes, operations (methods), and relationships.
Model associations, generalizations, and dependencies between classes.
🧭 Project Title:
Campus Map with Interactive Navigation

📄 1. Elements in UML Class Diagram


Element	Description
Class	Represents an entity or object in the system.
Attribute	Describes properties of a class.
Operation	Functions or methods the class can perform.
Relationship	Shows how classes interact (association, generalization, dependency).
🧱 2. Structural Aspects (Key Classes & Attributes)


Class Name	Attributes	Operations (Methods)
User	userId, name, email, userType	login(), logout(), viewMap()
Student (inherits User)	studentId, department	register(), viewNavigation()
Visitor (inherits User)	-	searchLocation(), getRoute()
Admin (inherits User)	adminId	updateMapData(), manageBuildings()
Map	mapId, mapVersion, lastUpdated	loadMap(), display(), filterCategory()
Location	locationId, name, type, coordinates	showOnMap(), getAccessibilityInfo()
Route	routeId, startPoint, endPoint, path	calculateRoute(), displayRoute()
GPSModule	gpsId, currentCoordinates	getCurrentLocation(), syncWithMap()
🔁 3. Behavioral Aspects (Sample Interactions)

User → login(): Authenticates credentials and grants access.
Student → viewNavigation(): Requests route to destination.
Map → display(): Shows current version of the map.
Admin → updateMapData(): Adds or edits map information.
GPSModule → getCurrentLocation(): Provides real-time coordinates.
🔗 4. Relationships


Relationship Type	Description
Generalization	Student, Visitor, and Admin inherit from User.
Association	User interacts with Map and Route.
Aggregation	Map contains multiple Location instances.
Dependency	Map depends on GPSModule for location updates.
🧾 5. Textual Description of UML Class Diagram

User (abstract class)
↳ Student, Visitor, Admin (inherits User)
User uses Map, requests Route, and views Location
Admin manages Map and Location
Map aggregates multiple Location objects
Route is calculated based on Location and GPSModule
GPSModule provides current location to Route and Map
✅ Result:

Successfully modeled the UML Class Diagram for the Campus Map with Interactive Navigation system, representing both structural and behavioral system elements.

📌 Conclusion:

Class diagrams offer a clear and organized view of a system's architecture, showing what the system is made of and how parts are connected. They are essential in object-oriented software design and serve as a blueprint for development and maintenance.
