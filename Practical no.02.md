Aim:To estimate project metrics such as effort, time, and cost using the COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) for the project: “Campus Map with Interactive Navigation”.

Objective:
Understand and apply COCOMO estimation techniques.
Estimate the effort (person-months) and time (development months).
Identify cost drivers relevant to the project.
Analyze advantages and drawbacks of the COCOMO model.

Theory:
📐 1. Project Estimation Techniques:
Project estimation refers to predicting the time, effort, cost, and resources required to complete a software project. Common estimation techniques include:

Expert judgment
Analogy-based estimation
Parametric models (e.g., COCOMO)
Use-case estimation

2. COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model):
A widely used algorithmic estimation model developed by Barry Boehm. It estimates effort based on lines of code (LOC) and a set of project-specific attributes.

COCOMO has three levels:

Basic – Quick estimation using LOC and project type.
Intermediate – Includes cost drivers like reliability, complexity.
Detailed – Adds analysis of all software components.

3. Use Case: Campus Map with Interactive Navigation

Description:

A web/mobile application that allows users to:

View the campus map.
Search buildings (e.g., library, labs).
Get real-time walking directions.
Interact with 3D or zoomable map interfaces.
Include accessibility features and offline mode.

4. Applying Basic COCOMO Model
Formula:

Effort (E)
=
a
×
(
KLOC
)
b
Effort (E)=a×(KLOC) 
b
 
Development Time (D)
=
c
×
(
E
)
d
Development Time (D)=c×(E) 
d
 
Where:

a, b, c, d are constants depending on project type:
Organic: Small, simple software – a=2.4, b=1.05, c=2.5, d=0.38
Semi-Detached: Intermediate – a=3.0, b=1.12, c=2.5, d=0.35
Embedded: Complex, hardware-tied – a=3.6, b=1.20, c=2.5, d=0.32

Assumptions:

Estimated size = 12,000 LOC (12 KLOC)
Project Type = Semi-Detached
Effort

Effort=3.0×(12)

 ≈3.0×17.1=51.3 person-months
Development Time

Development Time=2.5×(51.3)

 ≈2.5×4.3=10.75 months
💸 5. Project Cost Estimation:
Assume:

Cost per person-month = ₹60,000
Total Cost

Total Cost=51.3×60,000=₹30,78,000

6. Advantages of COCOMO:
Provides early estimates during planning.
Helps in budgeting and resource allocation.
Based on empirical data – quantifiable.
Useful for cost-benefit analysis.

7. Drawbacks of COCOMO:
Depends heavily on accurate LOC estimation.
Doesn’t factor in modern agile practices.
Less accurate for new/innovative projects.
Doesn’t consider reuse, AI, or automation tools.

Result:
Estimated that the Campus Map with Interactive Navigation project will require 51.3 person-months, take approximately 10.75 months to develop, and cost around ₹30.78 Lakhs, based on the Basic COCOMO Model.

Conclusion:
The COCOMO model is a powerful technique for estimating software projects, especially when clear code size and project type are known. It helps in setting realistic expectations and efficient planning.
