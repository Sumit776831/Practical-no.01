Aim:
To design test suites for software applications, understanding different types of testing and frameworks, and writing test cases as per V-Lab format.

🧪 Objective:
Understand the importance of software testing.
Explore various software testing frameworks.
Learn about test cases and types of testing.
Write unit testing and integration testing cases.
📚 Theory Overview:


Topic	Description
Software Testing	Process of verifying and validating that a software application works as intended.
Need for Testing	Ensures software quality, security, usability, and reliability.
Testing Frameworks	Structured guidelines like JUnit, Selenium, PyTest, etc., to organize testing activities.
Test Cases	Specific conditions under which a tester assesses a software application.
Types of Software Testing	Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Acceptance Testing, etc.
Unit Testing	Testing of individual components/modules.
Integration Testing	Testing interactions between integrated modules.
📝 Task: Write Test Cases

You need to write test cases in the format given under the CASE study tab on V-Lab portal.

Format for writing a Test Case:

Test Case ID
Objective
Inputs
Expected Output
Actual Output
Result (Pass/Fail)
🧭 Example Based on Campus Map with Interactive Navigation

Sample Unit Test Case:


Field	Content
Test Case ID	TC_01
Objective	Verify if the login functionality works correctly
Inputs	Username: student01, Password: correctpass
Expected Output	Redirects to Home page with user logged in.
Actual Output	As expected (assuming pass).
Result	Pass
Sample Integration Test Case:


Field	Content
Test Case ID	TC_05
Objective	Verify if after login, the user can access the navigation module
Inputs	Logged-in student clicks “Get Directions”
Expected Output	Navigation screen is displayed.
Actual Output	As expected.
Result	Pass
✅ Result:

Designed proper Test Suites for Unit Testing and Integration Testing based on the project Campus Map with Interactive Navigation.

📌 Conclusion:

Testing is crucial to deliver error-free and efficient software. Writing structured test cases ensures traceability, clarity, and improves software robustness.
